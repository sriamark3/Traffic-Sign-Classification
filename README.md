# Traffic-Sign-Classification
 New technologies such as Artificial Intelligence are essential to the automation business. Deep learning and AI are particularly closely related to the automotive industry. International corporations are developing self-driving 
  automobiles and autonomous vehicles, including Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and others. The ability of the cars to read traffic signs and make decisions based on that interpretation is one of the technology's main 
  features. Traffic signs are categorised into many categories, such as speed restrictions, no entry, turn left or right, children crossing, and prohibiting the passing of large vehicles. The goal of this research is to develop a 
  convolutional neural network model that can categorise pictures of traffic signs into various groups. 

- Constructed a CNN-based Machine Learning model to classify images of various traffic signboards into different specified categories, and build a traffic sign recognition system.
- Supervised overall design of the project, and orchestrated collective progress by distributing work among teammates as per divisional expertise.
- Interpreted research results to extract information, design, and test our ML model.
- Presented work to overseeing course instructor.
